# 📍 Project Roadmap: RTL-SDR Drone Direction Finder

This document outlines the planned development phases for building a drone-mounted signal direction finding system using an RTL-SDR on a Raspberry Pi. Each phase builds toward a fully functional, mobile signal-tracking solution.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Local SDR Testing

**Goal**: Verify that RTL-SDR can detect a known signal source (e.g., walkie-talkie) using Python on a local development machine.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Install RTL-SDR drivers and Python libraries (`pyrtlsdr`)
- [ ] Write a basic Python script to read data from RTL-SDR
- [ ] Test with a walkie-talkie to confirm signal detection
- [ ] Visualize signal strength / spectrum
- [ ] Log signal data for offline analysis

## 🔄 Phase 2: Raspberry Pi Setup

**Goal**: Deploy and test SDR code on the Raspberry Pi. Ensure SSH access and data transfer from Pi to development machine.

### Tasks:
- [ ] Enable SSH and configure Raspberry Pi networking (static IP or mDNS)
- [ ] Install RTL-SDR tools and Python dependencies on Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Upload working SDR code from Phase 1
- [ ] Run signal capture script on Pi and log results
- [ ] Transfer log files or stream data back to laptop for visualization
- [ ] Optional: Set up Wi-Fi hotspot or remote desktop for headless operation

*More phases (e.g., direction finding, drone mounting, GPS integration, etc.) will be added after Phases 1 and 2 are completed and validated.*
